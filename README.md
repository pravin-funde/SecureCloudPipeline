# 🔐 SecureCloudPipeline

A modern, security-first DevSecOps pipeline that scans, hardens, and securely deploys a containerized Python Flask web application to AWS — all with infrastructure as code.

---

## 🚀 What This Project Covers

✅ Build a secure Docker image  
✅ Automatically scan for vulnerabilities  
✅ Detect secrets, misconfigurations, and insecure code  
✅ Deploy securely to cloud using Terraform

## 🛠️ Tools & Stages

| Stage                  | Tool Used      | Purpose                                  |
|------------------------|----------------|------------------------------------------|
| Container Scanning     | **Trivy**       | Scan Docker image for OS & app CVEs      |
| Static Analysis (SAST) | **Semgrep**     | Scan Python source code for bugs/CVEs    |
| IaC Security           | **Checkov**     | Audit Terraform configs for misconfigs   |
| Secrets Detection      | **Gitleaks**    | Detect hardcoded secrets in repo         |
| CI/CD                  | **GitHub Actions** | Automate builds, scans, reporting     |
| Deployment             | **Terraform (AWS)** | Provision secure infrastructure      |

## 🐳 Docker Image Hardening

Initial base image (`python:3.10-slim`) had 90+ vulnerabilities (OS + Python packages).

### 🔧 Fixes Applied:
- Switched to Alpine: `python:3.10-alpine` ✅
- Installed only essential system packages
- Removed build dependencies post-install
- Created and used a non-root user for app execution
- Used `--no-cache` and cleaned APT/apk caches

### 📉 Before (Debian-based)
securecloud-flask (debian 12.11)
Total: 90 (LOW: 68, MEDIUM: 18, HIGH: 3, CRITICAL: 1) + Python-pacakge vulnerabilities.


### ✅ After (Alpine-based)
securecloud-flask (alpine) and python package updates
Total: 0 vulnerabilities 🎉


> All scans are triggered via GitHub Actions on every push.
